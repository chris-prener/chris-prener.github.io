          <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Advising is a critical part of the undergraduate experience here at Saint Louis University. Like <a href="/resources/letters">letters of recommendation</a>, I find that students are often unsure of how best to utilize and prepare for advising meetings. This post is meant to provide guidance specifically to my advisees, but is generally reflective of priorities that the Sociology and Computational Geospatial Science programs have in terms of advising.</p>
<h2 id="two-advisers-one-goal">Two Advisers, One Goal</h2>
<p>Every student at SLU should have <em>two</em> advisers, an academic adviser in the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), or in their home college, and a faculty mentor. You are strongly encouraged to meet with both your academic adviser and your faculty mentor on a regular basis since they serve slightly different functions.</p>
<p>The academic adviser is best positioned to make sure you are on pace to graduate and to help you navigate the <a href="https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/student-resources/core-curriculum/core-requirements.php">core curriculum requirements</a>. As your faculty mentor, I have a <em>general</em> sense of the core curriculum requirements but will send you to your academic advisers for specific questions.</p>
<p>My role, in contrast, is to provide you with specific guidance on how to complete your major or minor in Sociology or Computation Geospatial Science. Faculty tend to know the specifics of program requirements and upcoming course offerings before CAS academic advisers do, and are also better positioned to provide advice on next steps after SLU like careers or graduate schools.</p>
<h2 id="your-role">Your Role</h2>
<p>Advising is not a one-way relationship - like all relationships, both of us have a job to do. Your job is to be <em>actively</em> engaged in your academic career. Please create and maintain a <strong>four year plan</strong> that includes <em>all</em> of the courses you will need to take each semester to stay on course for graduation. The Sociology and Anthropology Department has created planning grids to help with this process:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sociology Major <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sociology Major with Honors <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Sociology Minor <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Computational Geospatial Science Minor <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>You don't have to use these worksheets, but they can be helpful for getting started. Many of my students create a digital version of these grids in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. However you create your four year plan, you need one and you need to keep it updated!</p>
<h2 id="when-to-come-see-me">When to Come See Me</h2>
<p>If I am your academic adviser, you should see me <em>at least</em> twice per year. I send out mass emails prior to course registration asking you to signup for an advising slot. If you don't have much to talk about, sign up for a single 15 minute slot. If you have a lot to chat about, sign up for two or even three contiguous 15 minute slots.</p>
<p>Just because these are my two regular advising periods does not mean I am otherwise unavailable. Feel free to <a href="mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu">email me</a> to set-up a time to talk. I am <strong>always</strong> happy to meet with my advisees to check-in or provide guidance in between course registration advising sessions.</p>
<h2 id="getting-ready-for-our-meeting">Getting Ready for Our Meeting</h2>
<p>Before you come in for your advising meeting, update your <strong>four year plan</strong>. Make sure you have a good sense of what requirements you have completed and what courses you still need to take. If you are coming in for a pre-registration meeting, take a look at Banner and browse through the courses that are available. You can also stop by the Sociology and Anthropology Department to pick up an updated list of courses available for the next semester. Please come to your meeting with some ideas about what courses you'd like to take for the upcoming semester.</p>
<p>If you are meeting with me during the <strong>spring</strong> of your <strong>junior year</strong>, you will need to bring a form from your CAS adviser that lets them know what you still need to complete for your major or minor. If you don't bring it, you will have to come back later and have me sign the form.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-during-our-meeting">What to Expect During Our Meeting</h2>
<p>When we meet, I'll go through a copy of the appropriate degree checklist and four year plan (see &ldquo;Your Role&rdquo; above) and make sure you're making forward progress towards completing your major or minor. I'll also check in about any plans you might have for summer internships, research experience, jobs, and/or graduate school.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-after-we-meet">What to Do After We Meet</h2>
<p>If you need forms or petitions signed, please make sure you follow-up with me. Please also pay attention to registration dates and register for courses as soon as possible to ensure that you get seats in the courses that you need to be in. I am typically unable to help if a course fills up, so please make sure you have all holds removed and are able to register on-time for courses. Once you are registered, stay in touch and let me know if any issues arise. Otherwise, plan to update your <strong>four year plan</strong> with your registered courses and start planning for the next semester!</p>
