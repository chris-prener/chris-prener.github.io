      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of the rules for success in college are not things we typically share with you when you start at SLU (or any other institution). Sociologists and education researchers have started calling this the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;hidden curriculum&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and universities are putting a lot of effort in particular into making sure that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chronicle.com/article/We-Must-Help-First-Generation/244830&#34;&gt;first generation college students&lt;/a&gt; (those without family who have been to college) get resources to navigate all of these relationships. This is important, worthy work, but I also see students who are not first generation struggle to adapt to college life. This set of resources covers tips for both &lt;a href=&#34;/resources/students/overview-teaching/&#34;&gt;coursework&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;/resources/students/overview-advising/&#34;&gt;advising&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you find it useful!&lt;/p&gt;
