      <title>Emergency Medical Services</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) project is my original graduate research project. Begun in 2009 as a pilot study and expanded between 2011 and 2015 as my dissertation research, the project has aimed to understand the experience urban EMS work. My interest in the topic is rooted in my own experience as an Emergency Medical Technician. This research has culminated in a book manuscript, &lt;em&gt;Medicine at the Margins&lt;/em&gt;, which is under contract with Fordham University Press and undergoing minor revisions after peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I argue that three types of marginality define EMS work: (1) the EMS system has a tenuous relationship with both the formal health care system and the broader first responder system, existing in a gray area between the two; (2) marginalized work conditions, which include 24-hour shifts filled with downtime spent fighting boredom, characterize EMS work; and (3) EMS work in practice is defined not by the most acute patients but those with chronic mental health issues, substance use disorders, and housing instability who live in particular neighborhoods within cities. Providers&#39; views of where these patients live, which I measure with qualitative GIS techniques, diverge from more objective measures of EMS work in this city. These findings allow me to provide empirical evidence of how neighborhood stigmas arise through work routines and institutional practices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Literacy and Mental Illness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have also focused on poor health through an NIH-funded project (R01 support now completed) designed to explore the effects that limited literacy has on the lives of individuals living with severe and persistent mental illness. This project includes collaborators at Northeastern University and the University of Adelaide in Australia. Our publications emphasize that limited literacy, when measured appropriately, is a significant barrier to recovery for mental health service consumers. A majority of individuals in our research read at or below the 8th-grade level, meaning that they read well below the population mean reading level in the United States. Moreover, we find that these individuals work to conceal both their identities as mental health service users and their limited literacy from others, believing that most people would judge them for one or both of these realities.&lt;/p&gt;
