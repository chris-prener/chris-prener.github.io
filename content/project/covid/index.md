My interest in public-facing work has inspired an [eighteen-month public science project](https://slu-opengis.github.io/covid_daily_viz/index.html) to compile and disseminate descriptive statistics about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Missouri. You can view the [data set creation code](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/MO_HEALTH_Covid_Tracking) and data [vizualization code](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/covid_daily_viz).

In a manuscript currently under review for *Contexts*, I describe this as a variation on our discipline's notion of "public sociology" - descriptive empirical work rooted in moving public discourse, rather than disciplinary knowledge, forward.

I have leveraged these data with colleagues at all three major St. Louis universities and local community organizations for several publications and papers in progress. This work aims to understand variations in spatial and social factors associated with the pandemic.
