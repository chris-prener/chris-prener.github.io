In the course of my substantive work, I have developed `R` packages to advance my research agenda. To accompany these software tools, I have written several papers describing their intellectual contributions. These include several discrete areas - geocoding and address normalization, interpolating population estimates, and qualitative GIS data collection and analysis. These papers emphasize the specific contributions of the specific software libraries and underscore a shared emphasis on reproducibility, open data, and decreasing barriers for everyone to participate in science.
