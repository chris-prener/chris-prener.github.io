Chris is an urban and medical sociologist with an interest in mixed methods research designs that incorporate spatial data. Chrisâ€™s current research focuses on the impact that population decline and segregation have had on St. Louis, Missouri across a number of outcomes, including vacancy, crime, and poor health. In addition to pursuing these questions, he actively maintains several open source software projects to make spatial research more reproducible and St. Louis data more accessible. Chris is also the maintainer of a [COVID-19 tracking project for Missouri](https://slu-opengis.github.io/covid_daily_viz/), focused on harmonizing data from various sources to create data visualizations of regional and statewide patterns in cases, deaths, and health disparities. As part of this work, he shares regular data updates via his newsletter, [*River City Data*](https://chrisprener.substack.com). He is also the author of a forthcoming book on urban Emergency Medical Services work and has published articles on precarious work, COVID-19 outcomes, and the relationship between literacy and poor mental health.
