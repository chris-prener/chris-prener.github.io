abstract: Selecting the appropriate statistical tests for data analysis is a critical skill for the infection preventionist (IP), both for analyzing their own data as well as evaluating the scientific literature methodology. Obtaining results from data analyses has never been easier thanks to computational improvements, but the interpretation of results relies on a keen awareness that the approach was sound. The purpose of this primer is to introduce the infection preventionist to the ideas behind hypothesis testing with a focus on statistical test selection.
