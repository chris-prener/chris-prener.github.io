abstract: "Geocoding, the process of converting a street address into a pair of coordinates that facilitate mapping, is a perennial challenge for researchers. Both technical and practical barriers exist to geocoding itself and creating reproducible workflows that string multiple geocoders together (so-called “composite” geocoders). This article presents a suite of open-source tools designed to standardize American addresses and geocode them. These tools culminate in a composite geocoder for the city of St. Louis, Missouri, which serves as a proof-of-concept for developing sophisticated geocoding processes. We test this geocoder on a data set of 1,822 homicides for St. Louis between 2008 and 2018, comparing the results of our tools to a range of commercial providers. We find varying levels of efficiency and accuracy across the available commercial platforms and demonstrate that our in-house tools provide high positional accuracy with significant efficiency increases."
